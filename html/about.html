      <h5>About</h5>
      <div class="about"> <br>Seneca King Community Centre started off as a haven for families with a low economic status.  We here at Seneca King, pride ourselves with financially affordable rates that allows families such as these, to fully experience recreational activities. The Seneca King recreational facilties offer many programs and classes such as art classes, drama club, taekwondo, etc. The staff work their hardest to provide the best quality of service to our clients as we make sure they are enjoying the activities safely and responsibly, while having fun doin it. Our main goal is to provide this community a place of inclusiveness where they feel they belong.</br> <br>
      Some of the challenges that arose from building the centre were deciding on a affordable rate for programs, the equipment needed for such activities and spreading the word out to the community. Spreading the word was especially difficult as we had to make flyers/posters, create radio commercials, and create several social media accounts as well. </br> <br> But in spite of this, we overcame these obstacles because we worked together as one family, and as one community </br>
